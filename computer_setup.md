# Computer setup

Here's what you need to install on your computer:

- The latest version of [DevkitPro](http://devkitpro.org). You can do a full install, or install only DevkitARM + ctrulib.
- Download [Aemstro](https://github.com/smealum/aemstro) and place its content in "msys", inside your devkitPro install folder. (ex: ````C:\devkitPro\msys````)
- A C++ compatible IDE like [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads), or a code editor like [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org).
- An FTP client like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org) or [WinSCP](http://winscp.net) to upload homebrews  on your 3DS using wi-fi.
- Latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org).
- Create a working directory. (for example ````C:\3DS````). All our projects will go in here.

Linux users: you'll find more setup info on [3Dbrew](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment).
