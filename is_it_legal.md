# Is it legal?

Yes, reverse-engineering a video game console and making homebrew software for it is 100% legal.

The only thing that is illegal is piracy, but pirating 3DS retail or eShop games is impossible with Ninjhax.

This tutorial is only here to help you develop and play 3DS homebrews, so don't worry and have fun!
