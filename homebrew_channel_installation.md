# Homebrew Channel installation

Follow these steps to install the homebrew launcher (or "hbmenu") on your 3DS.

This needs to be done only once:

- Download [Ninjhax's homebrew starter kit](http://smealum.net/ninjhax/dl/starter.zip) and unzip it at the root of your SD / microSD card.
- Insert the SD / microSD card in your console.
- Go on Ninjhax's website and [generate the QR code corresponding to your console's firmware](http://smealum.net/ninjhax/#qrcode). (you can find your firmware version in the "Settings" app, on the upper screen.)
- Enable your 3DS' wi-fi connection.
- Start the game Cubic Ninja, choose "Create", then "QR code", and finally "Scan QR code". 
- Scan the QR Code, then follow on-screen instructions to enable the exploit and start hbmenu.

The next times you turn your console on, just launch Cubic Ninja, choose "Create", then "QR code" and hbmenu will start directly.

If someday you want to uninstall Ninjhax (or install it on another console), you need to delete your save file.<br>
(go to Cubic Ninja's main menu and press L+R+X+Y)
