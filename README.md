# Introduction

This document will explain in detail how to develop homebrews (applications / games) for Nintendo 3DS, 2DS and New 3DS.

We will code them in C/C++, with ctrulib's help, and play them with Ninjhax and hbmenu.

Basic notions of programming are required, even if they come from another language (Java, PHP, JS, ...).

Note that the 3DS homebrew scene is very young, and many things are still impossible to do. (see the limitations page).

But we're here to make it as simple as possible!

Happy coding!
