# Hello template!

First, let's see what a 3DS homebrew project looks like:

The template folder contains:
- a source folder, containing a main.c file. (the source code of our homebrew).
- a data folder, that will be used to store our program's assets (images, music, ...).
- an assets folder, that will be used to store our program's assets (images, music, ...).
- an icon.png file (a 48x48px image displayed in hbmenu).
- a makefile file (used to build our homebrew in .3dsx).

Most 3DS projects have a similar structure, and it's recommended to follow this example for your future projects.
