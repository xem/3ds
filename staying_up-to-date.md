# Staying up-to-date

Most of the frameworks, libraries and homebrews that you will discover here are in intense development and get frequent updates from their authors, to fix bugs or to add new features.

We advise you to check regularly if a new version of DevkitPro (+ ctrulib) or Ninjhax (+ hbmenu) is available, and install it!
