Here's what you need to get started:

- A Nintendo 3DS / 3DS XL / 2DS with a firmware version between 4.0.0-7 and 9.2.0-20 + a SD card.<br>
or <br>
- A New 3DS with a firmware between 9.0.0-20 and 9.2.0-20 + a micro SD card.
- An SD / microSD card reader.
- A copy of the 3DS game "Cubic Ninja". It has to be in the same region as your 3DS (Europe, USA or Japan).

Note: the Gateway 3DS flashcard can also launch homebrews, but only in .3ds and .cia formats.<br>
This tutorial will focus on .3dsx homebrews, compatible with Ninjhax + hbmenu.
